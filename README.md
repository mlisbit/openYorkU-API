#Open YorkU API
###A Restful API for all things York University.

####Why is this being built?
York University is the 3rd largest university in Canada, and with the recent addition of Lassonde school of Engineering - it's about time something like this existed. Though I doubt openYorkU will become officially adapted, I hope York will see the potential and allow for easier access to their information.

With open data, students may create brilliant apps around it, and profs will have a large data set to work with and discover things otherwise overlooked. Tying this type of service around clubs, news and events; information will travel faster throughout the campus. The world will become aware of all the great things York University offers.

####Universities with API's of their own.
  * [Waterloo University](https://github.com/uWaterloo/api-documentation)
  * [Berkeley University](https://developer.berkeley.edu/)
  * [University of Michigan](http://developer.it.umich.edu/)
  * [others...](http://blog.mashape.com/list-of-15-university-apis/)
  
####Possible app ideas.
  * improved map of campus 
    * plot all food buildings, recreational areas, parking lots, and libraries.
    * directions to everything.
    * find the nearest bathroom facilities, art exhibits, or other place of interest.
    * find currently open restaurants and buildings. 
    * *not enough people know about all the great food places at York, cool study spots, and recreational areas.*
  * ratings 
    * courses (easiness/usefullness)
    * buildings (cleanliness/architectual appeal)
    * restaurants (cleanliness/cost/quantity)
  * social timetable picker (like [uwflow](https://uwflow.com/))
    * pick timetables with your friends, so you're all in the same courses. 
  * event notifications
    * with support for clubs to post events, every event would be known about 
    * (no more missing a bakesale, or a poster sale in Vari Hall.)
